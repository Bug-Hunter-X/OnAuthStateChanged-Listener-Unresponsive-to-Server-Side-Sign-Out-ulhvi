The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's authentication state changes due to an explicit sign-out operation performed on the server-side. This can lead to an unexpected behavior where the client-side app fails to recognize the user is logged out.  This is especially problematic if the app relies on the listener to update its UI or perform actions based on the authentication state.
