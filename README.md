# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Unresponsive to Server-Side Sign-Out

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener fails to trigger when a user is signed out on the server. The client-side application remains unaware of the logout, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `serverSignOutBug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `serverSignOutSolution.js` file presents a solution using a combination of server-side sign-out confirmation and manual UI updates to address this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Set up a Firebase project and enable authentication.
2.  Run `serverSignOutBug.js`.
3.  Observe that when the user is signed out on the server, the UI doesn't reflect the logout.
4. Run `serverSignOutSolution.js` to see the solution in action.

## Solution:

The issue arises from the asynchronous nature of server-side operations. The solution involves explicitly signaling the client when a server-side logout is successful, typically by sending a confirmation message. The client then manually updates the UI to reflect the logged-out state.
